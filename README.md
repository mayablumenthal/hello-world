# hello-world
Why am I doing this? I don't know. But here it is.

My name is Maya, I am a twelve-year-old student.
I love Harry Potter, Star Wars, Star Trek, The Hunger Games, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
One day, in my school's gifted program class when the teacher allowed us to play games, I was playing chess with my friends when I suddenly had an idea: "TRI-DIMENSIONAL WIZARD CHESS!!!"
I know, I am a nerd.
So after trying to think of some failed ideas for ACTUAL tri-dimensional wizard chess, which was voice-activated and would make the pieces hop from board to board and battle each other by talking to them, I decided to instead CODE a game of tri-dimensional wizard chess.
The only problem was that I had never coded a thing before in my life and I would have no idea how to go about coding this. 
Therefore, here I am, and I will be trying to code this via trial, error, research, guessing, and consuming lots of potato chips.
